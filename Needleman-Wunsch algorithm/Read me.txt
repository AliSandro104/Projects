The program uses the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm to align two sequences of DNA.
It takes as input a file in FASTA format containing two sequences of DNA, the score for matches, trhe score for mismatches and the gap penalty.
It outputs a file containing the two DNA sequences optimally aligned using the given scoring scheme.
